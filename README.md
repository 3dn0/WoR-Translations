# WoR-Translations
This repository contains the language files for the Windows on Raspberry imager tool.

Project page: https://www.worproject.ml

## Contribute
Updates or new language files can be submitted through pull requests or by creating an issue and attaching the translation file to it. See the status of the existing translations below.

The file structure is very similar to INI configuration files.

* The meaning of the translated phrases should be as close as possible to the **English** translation.

* The tool is called `Windows on Raspberry` or simply `WoR` (note that the `Pi` word is missing). This name shouldn't be translated in any language. 

Issues related to the WoR tool should be reported on the [dedicated bug tracker](https://www.worproject.ml/bugtracker), not on this repository!
